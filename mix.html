                    <h1>Components of a Well-Balanced Potting Mix</h1>
                    <div class="text">
                        <h2>Peat Moss or Coconut Coir</h2>
                        <p>Peat moss, derived from decomposed plant material, is prized for its ability to retain moisture and improve aeration.
                        </p>
                        <p>Coconut coir, an eco-friendly alternative, is a fibrous material extracted from coconut husks, offering similar benefits.</p>
                        <h2>Perlite</h2>
                        <p>A lightweight volcanic mineral, perlite aids in improving drainage and preventing compaction in the potting mix.</p>
                        <p>Its porous structure enhances aeration, ensuring that plant roots receive an adequate oxygen supply.</p>
                        <h2>Vermiculite</h2>
                        <p>Vermiculite is a mineral that complements perlite by enhancing water retention, promoting consistent moisture levels within the mix.
                        </p>
                        <p>It provides a buffer against extremes in soil moisture, creating an ideal environment for plant roots.</p>
                        <h2>Compost</h2>
                        <p>Organic matter in the form of compost adds valuable nutrients to the potting mix.
                        </p>
                        <p>Compost enhances soil structure, fosters microbial activity, and promotes overall soil health.</p>
                        <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
                        <p>Some potting mixes come pre-enriched with slow-release fertilizers, while others require additional supplementation.
                        </p>
                        <p>Fertilizers provide essential nutrients for plant growth and development.</p>

                        <h2>Optimal Nutrient Availability</h2>
                        <p>A well-balanced potting mix ensures a consistent supply of nutrients, fostering healthy plant growth.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Enhanced Drainage</h2>
                        <p>Proper aeration and drainage prevent waterlogging, protecting plant roots from potential damage.</p>
                        <h2>Improved Water Retention</h2>
                        <p>The mix's ability to retain moisture contributes to consistent water availability for plants, especially in dry conditions.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Encourages Robust Root Development</h2>
                        <p>An ideal potting mix provides a loose, well-aerated environment that encourages the development of a strong and healthy root system.</p>
