                        <h2>Choosing the Right Plants</h2>
                        <p>Before diving into the planting process, it's crucial to select the right plants for your specific environment. Consider factors such as your region's climate, available sunlight, and soil quality. Opt for native plants as they are more likely to thrive in their natural habitat. Research the water and light requirements of your chosen plants to ensure they are compatible with your gardening space.</p>

                        <h2>Preparing the Soil</h2>
                        <p>Quality soil is the foundation for a successful garden. Begin by testing the pH level of your soil to determine its acidity or alkalinity. Based on the results, you may need to amend the soil with organic matter such as compost or manure to improve its fertility. Remove any debris or weeds from the planting area and ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.</p>

                        <h2>1. Seed Planting</h2>
                        <p>If you're starting from seeds, follow the instructions on the seed packet regarding planting depth and spacing. Ensure the soil is sufficiently moist but not waterlogged.
                        </p>
                        <h2>2. Transplanting</h2>
                        <p>When transplanting seedlings, handle them gently to avoid damaging their delicate roots. Dig a hole slightly larger than the root ball, place the seedling inside, and cover it with soil, pressing gently to eliminate air pockets.</p>
                        <h2>3. Container Gardening</h2>
                        <p>For those with limited space, consider container gardening. Choose pots with drainage holes, fill them with quality potting mix, and select plants that are suitable for container growth.
